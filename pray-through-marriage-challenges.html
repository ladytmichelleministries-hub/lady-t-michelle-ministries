    <p>Marriage is one of God’s greatest gifts—but even God-ordained marriages face seasons of difficulty. Whether the challenge is communication breakdowns, emotional distance, financial pressure, or unresolved hurt, Scripture reminds us that storms do not mean failure. They are often invitations to draw closer to God <em>together</em>.</p>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Key Scripture:</strong> “A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.” — Ecclesiastes 4:12
    </div>

    <h2>Why Prayer Is Essential During Marriage Challenges</h2>
    <p>When couples face conflict, it’s easy to turn inward, defend ourselves, or grow silent. Prayer shifts the focus from winning arguments to seeking God’s wisdom. Prayer invites God into the exact place where the struggle exists—softening hearts, surrendering pride, and restoring unity.</p>

    <h2>3 Powerful Scriptures to Pray Over Your Marriage</h2>

    <h3>1) When Communication Feels Broken</h3>
    <p>“Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry.” — James 1:19</p>
    <p><strong>Prayer focus:</strong> Listening with understanding instead of reacting defensively.</p>

    <h3>2) When Hurt or Unforgiveness Lingers</h3>
    <p>“Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.” — Ephesians 4:32</p>
    <p><strong>Prayer focus:</strong> Releasing resentment and choosing forgiveness.</p>

    <h3>3) When the Future Feels Uncertain</h3>
    <p>“Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding.” — Proverbs 3:5–6</p>
    <p><strong>Prayer focus:</strong> Surrendering control and trusting God with what you can’t fix on your own.</p>

    <h2>A Guided Prayer for Couples Facing Challenges</h2>
    <div class="callout">
      <p><strong>Prayer:</strong> Lord, You see our marriage clearly. You know the areas where we are struggling, the words left unsaid, and the wounds that still ache. We invite You into this season. Teach us to listen with love, forgive with grace, and trust You fully. Heal what is broken, restore what feels distant, and strengthen our covenant. We choose unity over division and faith over fear. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Encouragement for Couples in the Waiting Season</h2>
    <p>Some prayers are answered immediately. Others unfold over time. If your marriage still feels heavy after praying, remember: God is working even when you don’t see change yet. Healing is often a process, not a moment.</p>
    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Encouragement:</strong> “Let us not become weary in doing good… at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.” — Galatians 6:9
    </div>

    <h2>Walking Forward With Intention</h2>
    <p>Prayer is most powerful when paired with intentional action. Setting aside regular time to pray, reflect, and communicate can transform how you navigate challenges together.</p>
