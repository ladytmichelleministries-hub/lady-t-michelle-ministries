  <h2 style="text-align:center; margin-top:0;">Welcome</h2>

  <p>
    My name is <strong>Lady T. Michelle</strong>, better known as <strong>Latasha McFadgon</strong>,
    and I am the founder of <strong>Lady T. Michelle Ministries</strong>.
    I have been married for over <strong>16 years</strong> to my husband,
    <strong>Pastor James McFadgon</strong> of <strong>Holy Ground Ministry of Love</strong>.
    As a wife and ministry leader, I carry a deep burden to see marriages strengthened,
    restored, and covered in God’s grace.
  </p>

  <p>
    This ministry was birthed from a passion for helping singles and couples build relationships
    that honor God. I believe marriage is sacred, intentional, and worth fighting for—especially
    in a world where relationships are often challenged, rushed, or misunderstood.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through prayer, lived experience, and biblical wisdom, I felt called to create faith-based
    resources that support you at every stage of your journey—whether you are preparing for marriage,
    nurturing connection, or walking through difficult seasons.
  </p>

  <h3 style="margin-top:30px;">Our Marriage Journey</h3>
  <p>
    Like many couples, my husband and I have learned that marriage requires faith, humility,
    communication, and continual surrender to God. We’ve experienced seasons of growth,
    stretching, and restoration—and we’ve seen how prayer changes hearts and renews unity.
    Our journey has reinforced this truth: when God remains at the center, love can be rebuilt,
    peace can return, and purpose can be restored.
  </p>

  <p>
    That is why the journals offered through this ministry are designed to help you slow down,
    reflect, communicate honestly, and intentionally invite God into every part of your relationship.
    Each page is created with purpose—to strengthen faith, deepen connection, and remind you that
    you are not alone.
